You can find the instructions for this lab [here](https://cyrusvandrevala.com/teaching/csc/214/labs/hello-world.html).

You only need to update `src/main/java/com/csc/HelloWorld.java` with your implementation (other files can remain untouched).

## Testing

In this lab, you only need to update `src/main/java/com/csc/HelloWorld.java` with your implementation. The other files build the project, run automated tests, etc.
